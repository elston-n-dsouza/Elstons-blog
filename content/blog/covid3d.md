Recently, with the COVID-19 Pandemic still being a large part of our lives. At least in Melbourne (and Victoria) at large, where Stage 4 Restrictions still being enforced. All of us have been waiting for that solace from the various drugs and vaccines that have been heralded in the news. 

Just recently the [AstraZeneca vaccine](https://www.theage.com.au/business/companies/astrazeneca-puts-covid-19-vaccine-trial-on-hold-over-safety-concern-20200909-p55ts0.html), one of the forefront and most promising efforts, has been put on hold after a reported case of an adverse reaction. This is not entirely comforting, but we have little reason to doubt its safety or efficacy yet. This is because such occurances are entirely common, even in prior vaccine Phase 3 trials. 


However, this still calls in to question on what our insurance plan is when we are developing drugs and vaccine to tackle COVID-19. Are we entirely certain that a drug developed today will work tomorrow? 

A illustrating example is that of HIV. We still don't have a preventative vaccine (they are all stuck in Phase II), despite the fact that research has been continuously put forth since 1984.

While there are many reasons for not having a vaccine, but one simple explaination has to do with the rate at which the HIV virus mutates. 

There has been much research and interest into mutations and pathogens.  

> Mutations are changes in the genetic code of an organism. They typically happen when replication or repair occurs. 

Now, while most people think of X-Men mutants when they hear the word *mutation*, but far from it. Mutations, in most cases, are benign, that is they don't don't change anything to the organism. 

With that said  

# Mutations and SARS-CoV2?


# Why is this important? 

Mutations have been very important for a couple of reasons : 
1. They let us appreciate the evolutionary nature of the viruses. Although a slight caveat can be introduced due the huge founders effects that we have seen with COVID-19. 

2. We can target better drugs and vaccines. To the right person / right strain and so on. Mutations can block drug binding pockets, but most importantly can lead to drug/vaccine resistance. 

3. Evolutionary conserved regions, can serve as attractive drug targets.  


# What can we do about it? 

Recently, our work in the Ascher lab was published in [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0693-3/)
