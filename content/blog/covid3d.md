Recently, with the COVID-19 Pandemic still being a large part of our lives. At least in Melbourne (and Victoria) at large, where Stage 4 Restrictions still being enforced. All of us have been waiting for that solace from the various drugs and vaccines that have been heralded in the news. 

Just recently the [AstraZeneca vaccine]() 

# Mutations and SARS-CoV2?


# Why is this important? 

Mutations have been very important for a couple of reasons : 
1. They let us appreciate the evolutionary nature of the viruses. Although a slight caveat can be introduced due the huge founders effects that we have seen with COVID-19. 

2. We can target better drugs and vaccines. To the right person / right strain and so on. Mutations can block drug binding pockets, but most importantly can lead to drug/vaccine resistance. 

3. Evolutionary conserved regions, can serve as attractive drug targets.  


# What can we do about it? 

Recently, our work in the Ascher lab was published in [Nature Genetics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-020-0693-3/)
