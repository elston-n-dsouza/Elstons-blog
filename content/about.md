Hi! I am Elston, a student in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at the University of Melbourne and at the Baker Heart and Diabetes Institute. I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Biomedicine (Degree with Honours) under the supervision of A/Prof David Ascher. My current research involves exploring the differences in **mutational tolerances** between different ethnic populations using large whole genome datasets and bioinformatics tools developed by the Ascher lab. I completed my undergraduate studies at the same university with a Bachelor of Science (Major in Computational Biology) in 2019.

I am interested in *population genomics, structural biology, and statistical methods.*

All thoughts expressed are mine own and are in no way affiliated with the University of Melbourne or the Baker Institute.
